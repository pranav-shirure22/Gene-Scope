# <h1>Gene-Scope</h1>
<b>BioSeq Analyzer :</b>  A Tkinter-based GUI application built with Biopython for sequence fetching, GC content calculation, Central Dogma operations (DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein), and BLAST searches directly from NCBI.

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2><br>
Working with nucleotide sequences often requires using multiple tools (NCBI website, command-line utilities, or separate bioinformatics platforms). This makes it harder for students and beginners to quickly analyze sequences without technical complexity.

<h2>Solution:</h2><br>
BioSeq Analyzer provides an all-in-one GUI where users only need to enter an accession ID. It handles:<br>
Fetching sequences directly from NCBI<br>
Analyzing sequence composition (GC content)<br>
Performing Central Dogma operations<br>
Running BLAST searches<br>
Displaying results in a scrollable, user-friendly text box<br>

<h2>Features:</h2><br>
ðŸ”¹ Fetch Sequence â€“ Retrieve nucleotide sequences by accession ID<br>
ðŸ”¹ GC Content â€“ Calculate %GC instantly<br>
ðŸ”¹ Central Dogma â€“ Convert DNA â†’ RNA â†’ Protein<br>
ðŸ”¹ BLAST Integration â€“ Compare sequences against NCBI databases<br>
ðŸ”¹ GUI Powered by Tkinter â€“ No need for command-line knowledge<br>
